        <!-- Solution Overview -->
        <section>
            <h2>1. Solution Overview</h2>
            <p>The internal chatbot system is not just a simple communication tool but an intelligent virtual support center, designed to optimize the connection between employees and the enterprise's internal management systems. The standout feature of this solution lies in its deep personalization capability, allowing the chatbot to fully adapt to the specific characteristics of each enterprise, from operational processes and internal culture to industry-specific terminology. Instead of merely providing basic responses, the chatbot acts as a powerful assistant, helping employees resolve tasks quickly, accurately, and efficiently while reducing the burden on management departments.</p>
